# CoordinatorLayoutBehaviour
As the name says CoordinatorLayout in android is a container layout which allows easy coordination between its children. due to which we can achieve some pretty useful animations with much less code. this is superpowered FrameLayout. it has all the property of FrameLayout and the superpower comes from a parameter called as scrollFlags. more on that later. the magic in coordinatorlayout is not complete without the CollapsingToolbarLayout. the collapsingToolbarLayout is used for the animation, expanding and collapsing of the appbar in an activity.
